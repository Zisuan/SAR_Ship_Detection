# SAR_Ship_Detection

Ship Detection on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images using amplitude and phase data

## Dataset Description
### DSSDD (Dual-polarimetric SAR Ship Detection Dataset)
- **Content**: 50 dual-polarimetric SAR images from Sentinel-1.
- **Format**: Cropped into 1236 image slices (256x256 pixels).
- **Polarizations**: VV and VH, fused into RGB channels for pseudo-color images.
- **Ship Instances**: 3540, labeled with rotatable (RBox) and horizontal bounding boxes (BBox).
- **Colour Depth**: 8 bits/channel (PNG), original 16-bit images (TIFF) also included.

## Repository Structure
- `Amplitude_Phase/`: Contains data and file informations used for amplitude and phase data detection
- `RGB/`: Contains data and file informations used for RGB data detection.

## Installation and Usage

Instructions on how to set up the environment and run the scripts will be provided soon.
