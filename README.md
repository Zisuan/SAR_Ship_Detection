- **Format**: Cropped into 1236 image slices (256x256 pixels).
- **Polarizations**: VV and VH, fused into RGB channels for pseudo-color images.
- **Ship Instances**: 3540, labeled with rotatable (RBox) and horizontal bounding boxes (BBox).
- **Colour Depth**: 8 bits/channel (PNG), original 16-bit images (TIFF) also included.

### SSDD (SAR Ship Detection Dataset) 
- **Content**: 1160 images from three prominent satellites: RadarSat-2, TerraSAR-X, and Sentinel-1.
- **Format**:  Each image having dimensions of up to 500Ã—350 pixels.
- **Polarizations**:  Mix of polarization modes, including HH, HV, VV, and VH.
- **Ship Instances**: 2358 ship instances, labeled with rotatable (RBox) and horizontal bounding boxes (BBox).
- **Colour Depth**: .jpeg format, color depth of 24 bits.  

### OpenSARShip 
- **Content**: Sentienl-1 interferometric wide (IW) ground range detected (GRD) products and Sentienl-1 interferometric wide (IW) single look complex (SLC) products.
- **Format**:  For each Sentinel-1 SAR image, four subfolders provide four formats of ship chips - Original data, calibrated data, visualized data in pseudo-color, and visualized data in
grey scale.
- **Polarizations**:  VV and VH.

## Installation and Usage
For Amplitude and Phase data detection, Detectron2 models are used.  
[Detectron2 Installation Guide](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html)  
After Installation, Pick a model and its config file from [model zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md#coco-person-keypoint-detection-baselines-with-keypoint-r-cnn) and train a custom model using [custom_model.py](https://github.com/Zisuan/SAR_Ship_Detection/blob/main/Amplitude_Phase/Scripts/custom_model.py).  
After training, Run Inference Test on custom dataset using trained model weights using [Inference.py](https://github.com/Zisuan/SAR_Ship_Detection/blob/main/Amplitude_Phase/Scripts/Inference.py).  
For Real-time SAR Data detection, Set up a [Sentinel Account](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) and [install SentinelHub](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to use SentinelHub API to extract data, Run [Ship_Detection.py](https://github.com/Zisuan/SAR_Ship_Detection/blob/main/Amplitude_Phase/Scripts/Ship_Detection.py) using your own SH Configuration.     
  
For RGB data detection, Tensorflow models are used.  
[Tensorflow Installation Guide](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)  
After Installation, Download Pre-Trained Model from [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) and Configure the Training Pipeline to train a model.  
Various scripts needed for training can be found the [Script Folder](https://github.com/Zisuan/SAR_Ship_Detection/tree/main/RGB/Scripts).   
After training, Run Inference Test on custom dataset using trained model weights using [TF_Inference.py](https://github.com/Zisuan/SAR_Ship_Detection/blob/main/RGB/Scripts/TF_Inference.py).
